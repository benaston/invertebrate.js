invertebrate.js
===============

A purposefully simple and lightwieght client-side MVC framework. It offers:

 - dynamic template loading (with client-side caching)
 - support for multiple environment configurations
 - message-based model update notification
 - client-side routing (including optional interception of both anchors and form submissions)
 
If you like invertebrate.js, please let others know by <a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Check%20out%20invertebrate.js%2C%20a%20simple%20JavaScript%20client-side%20MVC%20framework.%20%23invertebrate.js%20%40benastontweet&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbenaston%2Finvertebrate.js" target="_blank">sending a tweet</a> (opens a form in a new window to send a tweet).

Please note: I intend to make the JavaScript here more idiomatic at some point in the future when I find time, hanging methods off prototypes, for example.
