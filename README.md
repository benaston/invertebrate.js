invertebrate.js
===============

*Please note: The example TODO application in this repository is pretty old and is in the process of being updated. I also, intend to modify the JavaScript in invertebrate.js itself to be more idiomatic, adding methods to the prototype object instead of the actual objects themselves (this codebase is somewhat inconsistent), but this is not high on my list of things to do at the moment.*

Yet another client-side web application JavaScript framework.
